### LEARN TO LOVE REJECTION.

Rejection is scary. It's daunting and paralyzing. Nobody likes the feeling of building up the courage to ask for something, just for the response to be "no". But, it's necessary. It unlocks doors that you didn't even know were there. All you have to do is ask.

If you commit yourself to loving rejection, you free yourself from your mind. Your mind hates it and will do everything in its power to avoid it. Don't let it win. Rejection is like a muscle; you have to flex it for it to become stronger. The only way to become okay with being rejected is to be rejected more — quite the paradox.

The greatest things in life come from asking for things. Closed mouths don't get fed. If you've done the work, ask for something. You'd be surprised how often the answer is "yes". This single thing dramatically changes your life. You single-handedly change your trajectory the moment you are okay with the possibility of hearing "no".

Make rejection a habit. Aim to be rejected once a day or once a week. Cold email somebody you want to work with or ask for the raise. The worst you hear is "no". The upside is you get what you want. Sounds like a win-win to me.

Asking for things and loving rejection in the process is a huge unlock. The best things to happen to myself or others around me are a result of continuously putting yourself in the position to be rejected. Embrace the feeling. Love being rejected, and you'll love the results.

### Immediate Feedback

Because mastery is an internal motivator → you know how to get better immediately

**→ Quick feedback**

1. Surgery
    
2. Sports
    
3. Agile Software
    

→ Builds feedback into the process

→ Programmers know how to steer

4. Experiment

We get this wrong in organizations:

→ We create quarterly reports, not immediate reviews

**Feedback on Feedback**

1. **Choose Your Metrics**: Task Not Ego
    
2. **Feedback Buddy**
    
3. **MFF** (Minimal Feedback for Flow)
    

How much feedback do I need to steer?

Out loud? In writing?

**Retro-Casting for Minimum Feedback**

1. What were your last three great flow states?
    
2. How often did you receive feedback?
    
3. What kind of feedback was most effective?
    

The problem-solving wheel consists of eight sequential steps, which revolve around the core idea of continuous improvement. Each step corresponds to a different phase of problem-solving and offers guiding questions to facilitate deeper understanding and effective solutions.

### Steps in the Problem Solving Process:

1. **Identify Problem**
    - **Question:** What’s going on?
2. **Gather Data**
    - **Question:** What do we know?
3. **Analyze Data**
    - **Question:** What are the root causes?
4. **Generate Solutions**
    - **Question:** What could we do?
5. **Select Solution**
    - **Question:** What’s the best thing to do?
6. **Plan Implementation**
    - **Question:** How do we go about it?
7. **Implement & Test**
    - **Question:** Have we solved the problem?
8. **Continue to Improve**
    - **Question:** Can we improve on what we have done?

### Using This Framework for Accurate Flow Feedback

1. **Identify Problems in Flow (Step 1)**
    
    Begin by identifying specific bottlenecks that disrupt your flow state. Ask, “What’s going on?”—whether it’s distractions, emotional misalignment, or a mismatch between skills and challenges.
    
2. **Gather Data About Your State and Environment (Step 2)**
    
    Use self-reflection and data from your environment (e.g., tracking tools, journaling) to gain insight into your current state. Ask, “What do I know about my triggers, emotions, and space?”
    
3. **Analyze Data to Uncover Root Causes (Step 3)**
    
    Dig deeper to identify the true sources of flow disruption. Ask, “What are the root causes?”—is it a poorly set up workspace, misalignment with tasks, or unclear goals?
    
4. **Generate Solutions to Enhance Flow (Step 4)**
    
    Brainstorm possible changes. Ask, “What could I do?”—this could involve rearranging your workspace, adjusting your daily routine, or setting clearer boundaries.
    
5. **Select the Most Effective Strategy (Step 5)**
    
    Choose one solution that seems most aligned with your desired flow state. Ask, “What’s the best thing to do?”—prioritize one or two changes to test.
    
6. **Plan Your Implementation (Step 6)**
    
    Outline specific steps to integrate this solution into your routine. Ask, “How do I go about it?”—define clear action items for integrating new tools or techniques.
    
7. **Test and Reflect (Step 7)**
    
    Implement your solution and reflect on its impact. Ask, “Have I solved the problem?”—use feedback loops, such as mood tracking or performance reviews, to assess the impact.
    
8. **Continue to Refine (Step 8)**
    
    Revisit the cycle periodically to ask, “Can I improve on what I’ve done?” This ensures your system evolves as your context and needs change, maintaining a state of flow over time.
    

### Applying the Wheel for Feedback Integration

The strength of this problem-solving wheel lies in its iterative nature. By treating each feedback loop as a new cycle, you can use it to maintain flow in your work and life:

- **Self Dimension:** Adjust personal habits and mindset.
- **Space Dimension:** Optimize your physical and digital environment.
- **Story Dimension:** Refine goals and clarify narratives.
- **Spirit Dimension:** Ensure actions are in alignment with core values.

Regularly using this wheel helps prevent stagnation and keeps you in a state of adaptive flow.

|**Tip**|**Description**|**Feedback Type & Staying on Track**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. The 5-Minute Rule**|If it takes less than 5 minutes, do it now. Yes, even if it’s getting up to stretch. Procrastination is for stretching, not tasks!|**Instant Completion Feedback**: Gives a quick sense of accomplishment, keeping momentum high by immediately clearing small tasks off your plate.|
|**2. Eat the Frog First**|Tackle the hardest task first thing in the morning. Frogs taste better when you’re not thinking about them all day.|**Priority Feedback**: Starting with the toughest task provides immediate feedback on tackling high-priority items, boosting motivation and clarity for the rest.|
|**3. Pomodoro Technique**|Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat. Because even tomatoes need a break!|**Interval Feedback**: Built-in break times offer short feedback loops on progress, preventing burnout and helping to maintain sustainable focus.|
|**4. Make a To-Do List**|Write down your tasks. Checking them off feels like a tiny victory dance every time.|**Progress Feedback**: Visual feedback of crossing off tasks provides a sense of progress and accomplishment, which motivates further action.|
|**5. Set Alarms**|Use alarms to remind you of tasks. Because nothing says “Get back to work” like a phone screaming at you.|**Time-Based Feedback**: Alarms serve as external triggers for time management, ensuring focus is maintained by signaling when to switch tasks or take breaks.|
|**6. Delegate**|Share tasks with others. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work (and gives you more Netflix time).|**Resource Feedback**: Delegating provides feedback on effective use of available resources, helping you stay on track by optimizing task distribution.|
|**7. Avoid Multitasking**|Focus on one task at a time. Multitasking is just doing multiple things poorly at once.|**Cognitive Load Feedback**: Reduces mental overload, providing clarity and feedback on how efficiently you can complete tasks when focused.|
|**8. Use Apps and Tools**|Utilize productivity apps. Let technology be the boss that tells you to get back to work.|**Automation Feedback**: Tools offer automated feedback loops (e.g., reminders, task tracking) to keep focus on high-priority tasks and reduce manual oversight.|
|**9. Break Tasks into Chunks**|Divide tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Eating an elephant is easier one bite at a time, not that you should eat elephants.|**Chunking Feedback**: Provides manageable feedback on progress for each chunk, making large tasks feel less daunting and maintaining a steady sense of achievement.|
|**10. Set Boundaries**|Learn to say no. Protect your time like it’s the last slice of pizza.|**Boundary Feedback**: Reinforces the value of protecting focus time, providing feedback on when to decline distractions or low-priority requests.|
|**11. Reward Yourself**|Give yourself a treat after completing tasks. Because who doesn’t work faster for chocolate?|**Reward Feedback**: Positive reinforcement encourages repeat behavior, using rewards as feedback to reinforce completion and motivate continued effort.|
|**12. Keep a Calendar**|Schedule your tasks and appointments. Because remembering everything is for elephants and computers, not humans.|**Planning Feedback**: Offers structural feedback through visible scheduling, helping to anticipate deadlines and allocate focus time effectively.|
|**13. Take Care of Yourself**|Get enough sleep, exercise, and eat well. A tired brain is like a computer running Windows 95. Slow and prone to crash.|**Physical State Feedback**: Provides physiological feedback on energy and focus, ensuring peak performance by maintaining well-being.|
|**14. Limit Social Media**|Use social media blockers during work hours. Facebook and Instagram can wait; your research paper can’t.|**Distraction Feedback**: Offers immediate feedback on distractions, making it easier to stay on track by reducing access to potential focus disruptors.|
|**15. Reflect and Adjust**|Review your progress regularly and adjust as needed. It’s like GPS rerouting you after a wrong turn.|**Reflective Feedback**: Provides feedback on overall effectiveness, enabling adjustments to strategies, tasks, and workflows to stay aligned with goals.|

### Case Study: Using the DIBB Framework for Feedback and Generating Flow

The **DIBB Framework** stands for **Data -> Insight -> Belief -> Bet**, and it provides a structured way to analyze situations, derive actionable insights, and align teams around key priorities. Originally popularized by companies like Spotify, this method is a visual and strategic approach for making decisions, prioritizing initiatives, and creating a feedback loop that continuously refines understanding and strategy.

By breaking down decisions into four key components, it ensures that organizations move through a logical flow that maintains clarity and cohesion:

1. **Data**: Start by gathering objective facts and metrics.
2. **Insight**: Analyze the data to uncover trends or gaps.
3. **Belief**: Turn insights into guiding beliefs about what should be done.
4. **Bet**: Act on those beliefs by committing resources to specific initiatives.

### Feedback Loops for Flow

The **DIBB Framework** also emphasizes the importance of feedback loops to continuously validate or challenge assumptions. This built-in feedback mechanism helps ensure that teams stay agile, learn from each iteration, and adapt their beliefs and bets based on real-world outcomes. By aligning with flow principles, this method provides a roadmap for creating a focused and feedback-rich environment that fosters both individual and collective flow.

### Applying the DIBB Framework in Practice

### Step 1: **Data**

In this example, Spotify looked at **how people were listening to music** over time. The data indicated that mobile users were rapidly increasing, while desktop users were declining. They also noticed a staffing imbalance—most of their developers were working on desktop solutions despite the mobile trend.

- **Feedback Role**: Data serves as the foundational feedback input. It’s a concrete reflection of reality that prompts initial observations and questions.

### Step 2: **Insight**

The team recognized two critical insights:

- Mobile was overtaking desktop as the primary music device.
- They had too few developers focused on mobile.
- **Flow Application**: These insights generate a sense of clarity and direction, which are key elements of the **Self** and **Story** dimensions in flow. By reducing ambiguity, it sets the stage for clear focus.

### Step 3: **Belief**

The insight led to a new belief: “We’re optimized for the wrong thing!” For long-term survival, Spotify needed to shift its focus to a **mobile-first** strategy.

- **Feedback Role**: The belief acts as a mental framework guiding decision-making. This stage also opens up space for debate, alignment, and strategic refinement, creating shared understanding and context.

### Step 4: **Bet**

Based on their new belief, Spotify made a bold bet: Hire more mobile developers, retrain desktop developers for mobile, and build infrastructure to support rapid mobile iteration.

- **Flow Application**: By committing resources and energy toward this specific direction, the team can now focus fully on the new mission, reducing internal friction and confusion. The “bet” represents the strategic action that pushes the team into flow by aligning resources with a clear challenge.

### How the DIBB Framework Supports Flow

1. **Clarity and Focus (Self & Story)**
    
    The structured approach reduces cognitive load by breaking complex decisions into smaller, digestible parts. The "Insight" and "Belief" steps help solidify a clear narrative, making it easier for teams to stay focused and engaged.
    
2. **Adaptability and Iteration (Space)**
    
    The feedback loop at the end of the framework ensures that insights and beliefs are revisited based on real-world outcomes, keeping teams adaptive. This flexibility is crucial for maintaining a dynamic state of flow as challenges and skills evolve.
    
3. **Alignment and Shared Purpose (Spirit)**
    
    By aligning around a shared belief and making bets as a team, everyone is connected to a larger mission. This alignment reduces internal resistance and fosters collective engagement, a critical aspect of group flow.
    

### Using the DIBB Framework for Flow-Driven Feedback

1. **Set Clear North Star Goals**
    
    Like Spotify’s decision to go “mobile-first,” identify one or two core priorities. This creates a strong guiding narrative.
    
2. **Create a Transparent Feedback Loop**
    
    Use data to validate beliefs and adjust bets. Encourage open communication around insights to avoid blind spots and maintain agility.
    
3. **Embrace Small Bets**
    
    Think of “bets” as experiments rather than rigid commitments. This mindset promotes a continuous flow of feedback, learning, and iteration.
    
4. **Empower Teams with Context**
    
    Share the reasoning behind beliefs and bets openly. When everyone understands the data and insights, they can make decisions autonomously, fostering flow at an individual and collective level.
    

By implementing the DIBB Framework, teams can transition from reactive problem-solving to proactive flow creation, where each step is supported by feedback, learning, and aligned purpose. This structured flow makes complex initiatives feel manageable and ensures that all actions are meaningfully connected to the bigger picture.

**DIPP Framework - prioritization and experimentation**

Spotify's use of the DIBB framework (Data -> Insight -> Belief -> Bet) is an interesting visual example of how to prioritize initiatives and align teams.

This method helps drive North Star goals by focusing efforts and offering context and guidance for individual teams.

    **Make It Their Meeting**
    
    Delegate the meeting like any other work:
    
    - Define what excellent looks like
    - Hold them accountable
    - Coach to success
    - Don't step in
    
    But how do I get what I need to lead? That's part 2...
    
    **Good Questions >> Great Directions**
    
    The easiest way to align on expectations is to preview the questions you want them to answer.
    
    If they can answer these well, you can have confidence that they are excellently managing their area (even individual contributors).
    
    Here are mine:
    
    **1. How are you doing?**
    
    Want people to produce outsized results? You need to care personally. You'll only know when to show up for them if you know them well.
    
    Get a tepid response? Ask again.
    
    **2. What's most important for us to focus on?**
    
    If it is their meeting, they set the agenda. Not only are you empowering them, but you also get to learn how they think.
    
    This will help you anticipate what they might miss.
    
    **3. How are you tracking against your goals?**
    
    I want data. Clear metrics. The more tangible, the better. If the goal isn't easily measured, then I want a few qualitative angles that are in tension to surface the truth.
    
    Don't be afraid to ask, "What is your confidence?"
    
    **4. Are there notable Wins/Losses to discuss?**
    
    The specific Win or Loss doesn't matter to me as much as:
    
    a) Can they separate big from small? b) Are they proactively sharing?
    
    My probing questions should uncover very little.
    
    **5. What problems are you focused on solving?**
    
    I don't expect perfection if we're driving hard and creating value.
    
    Instead, I expect them to have command:
    
    - Do they know the problems?
    - Do the solutions make sense?
    - Are they making good progress?
    
    **6. How are your people doing?**
    
    Your people are only as good as those that support them. Even individual contributors rely on others. Help them practice sizing up those around them.
    
    Make empathy a habit.
    
    **7. How are you getting better?**
    
    When your team is filled with curious and compounding professionals, the result is a team that's agile and resilient.
    
    To get there, create space for coaching those who coach others.
    
    **8. How can I support your success?**
    
    Hopefully, you've done this throughout the conversation, but it never hurts to ask them directly, "What else do you need to win?"
    
    - Remove obstacles.
    - Provide resources.
    - Repeat often.

- **Time Blocks**
