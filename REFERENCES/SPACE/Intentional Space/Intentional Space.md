You don't have to "do more" to hit the flow state.

The trick is cutting out anything that distracts you from the work.

That means removing 99% of everything you pay attention to all day. Every day.


SUMMARY

This document discusses the concept of leverage as a way to redefine productivity. By leveraging resources and technology, individuals and organizations can achieve more with less effort and time, ultimately leading to increased productivity.

The Problem with Productivity

Mainstream advice is Broken

‚Üí You just have to put the time in!

‚Üí Work harder!

‚Üí Hustle

‚Üí You get out what you put in

‚Üí Do more to get more

None of this acknowledges the real definition of productivity - its just work advice, not productivity advice

This advice focuses on the wrong side of the equation

A Big Symptom Of This:

‚Üí An obsession with hours worked

BUT,

Hours worked is not a determining factor in productivity

‚Üí There is wild disparity between success and results

Success varies wildly but hours worked can‚Äôt vary wildly as time is fixed

How is it possible that hours worked don‚Äôt dictate success?

Work Ethic ‚Üí Leverage Ethic

Ditch the notion of work ethic.

All that matters is what you create, produce or accomplish in this world.

Identifying with how much you work will destroy your life

Identify with what you produce and accomplish

Working hard is not impressive. Producing results is impressive.

Don‚Äôt identify as someone who DOES A LOT.

Identify as someone who GETS IT DONE

The more you can do and the less you can do it with, the more impressive

The Key To Gaining Leverage Is Embracing the Leverage Gap

‚Üí Acquiring leverage always has a front-end cost

‚Üí Don‚Äôt focus too much on the short-term - this requires long-term thinking

‚Üí ‚ÄúSpend time sharpening the axe‚Äù

‚Üí Get comfortable living in the leverage gap

Exercise:

1) Force yourself into the leverage gap by limiting your hours worked.

‚Üí Set a lower number

‚Üí And to keep output consistent, shift focus to leverage

‚Üí 7 hours per day to conquer your objectives

‚Üí If you force yourself into this container, you will get creative to find ways of matching output

2) Leverage Self-Assessment

‚Üí Ask yourself - ‚ÄúWhat would i need to do to cut my hours of work in half while increasing my output?‚Äù

Assembling Your Template of Flow


‚Üí Changing too much complexity will increase cognitive load

‚Üí Simple, repetitive music

### Keys to Creating a Flow-Prone Space  

#### **1. Minimize Variables & Clutter**  
- **Same Desk, Same Setup**: Consistency reduces cognitive load. Use a familiar, minimal workspace to signal your brain it‚Äôs time to focus.  
- **Avoid Clutter**: Remove unnecessary items. Every object should serve a purpose (e.g., tools easily accessed, no distractions).  

#### **2. Optimize Ergonomics & Tools**  
- **High-Spec Computer + Big Monitor**: Fast, reliable tech prevents frustration. A large screen reduces eye strain.  
- **Laptop/Monitor Stand + Wireless Keyboard/Trackpad**: Elevate the monitor to eye level for proper posture. Wireless peripherals reduce physical constraints.  
- **Standing Desk**: Allows alternating between sitting and standing, creating mild urgency (standing subtly encourages action).  

#### **3. Eliminate Distractions**  
- **Phone Out of Reach (and Off)**: Physical separation prevents impulsive checks.  
- **No Temptations**: Remove TVs, video games, snacks, or other triggers that derail focus.  
- **Noise-Canceling Headphones**: Block auditory distractions. Use them as a "do not disturb" signal to others.  

#### **4. Control Sensory Inputs**  
- **Sound**: Repetitive, rhythmic music (e.g., binaural beats) or white noise lowers cognitive load. Avoid complex playlists.  
- **Light**: Maximize natural light for energy and circadian alignment. Supplement with warm, focused task lighting.  
- **Temperature**: Maintain ~18¬∞C (65¬∞F)‚Äîcool enough to stay alert but comfortable.  
- **Smell**: Use calming scents (e.g., candles, essential oils). Smell directly impacts the amygdala, influencing mood.  

#### **5. Intentional Environment Design**  
- **Attractive, Comfortable Furniture**: Supports physical ease and mental clarity.  
- **Plants**: Improve air quality and add calming greenery.  
- **Expansive Views**: If possible, position near a window with a soothing view (nature, open spaces) to reduce stress and inspire.  

#### **6. Boundaries & Social Proofing**  
- **Avoid Unfit Spaces**: Coffee shops, sofas, or restaurants often lack focus-friendly conditions.  
- **Open Office Strategies**: If unavoidable, use headphones, limit engagement, and separate collaborative vs. deep work times.  

#### **7. Psychological Triggers**  
- **Clean + Organized**: A tidy space reduces negative emotions. Everything should have a place to minimize friction.  
- **"Flow Signaling"**: Rituals like replaying the same music or using a specific setup train your brain to enter flow faster.  

### **Why It Works**  
An intentional space removes resistance, aligns sensory inputs with focus, and creates subconscious cues for deep work. By curating variables (physical, digital, and social), you automate concentration and make flow the default state.
