**You don’t get to LIVE in Flow**

→ If you know where you are, you know what to do next

Understanding this map is the most useful

### Struggle

→ Flow is what happens when you learn a bunch of skills, that you can execute them automatically without conscious intervention

- Flow is what happens when 2-3 skills come together and get to use them in a new way

→ But you still need to learn the skills

This is what the Struggle phase is

Struggle = Beta Waves = Alert, Paying Attention, Anxiety, Cortisol

→ No way around this step

**Some of the time** - trigger fight response to get into flow

→ That moment to ATTACK and Extreme Struggle

**Struggle →** Short and Long Term Timeframes

→ It can be a GRIND and FRUSTRATING

**Is Frustration a sign were going in the wrong direction?**

→ In flow, it’s baked into the process

Flow Cycle = Creative Cycle

The Downside of a Working Memory

What you can hold in your mind → About 7 items

Problem is: with ideas, the brain can only hold 3-4 items at once

In struggle → knowledge and skill acquisition,

Crawl, Walk, Run

Crawl = Frustration

Take the frustration, but you keep going

**Graceful Struggling: Two Levels of Grit**

**The Grind:**

**Limits of Willpower:** Starts high in the way, and declines at the end of the day

→ That’s why we binge at night

→ Most important tasks at the beginning of the day

→ Food can work to reset willpower

→ Change your state to boost your willpower

**The Importance of Mindset:** Growth Mindset, Talent is just a starting point

→ Fixed Mindset = Don’t believe you can get better

→ Brain won’t even try because from its perspective its not worth it

Big & **Clear Goals:** Align with your values and purpose

→ Divide your day, and get wins throughout the day

→ Introduces wins throughout the day with dopamine

**Peak Exits:** Stop when you’re most excited

→ Quit when you’re fired up

→ You bring that energy into the next session

### Release

You take your mind OFF the problem

**Struggle → Then Relax**

Deep Embodiment Activities work best

→ Low Grade Physical activity, but not into exhaustion

- Nitric Oxide → Releases the stress hormones
- Walk or work in garden
- Einstein - sailed sail boat
- Like a shower after work, creates the release after struggle

**Building a Trigger List**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/dc7e4e54-b0b1-42f4-8a82-24e695ca401c/Untitled.png)

Take yourself up to the top line of Struggle, then go into Release

**Turbo-Boosting Release**

**The Macgyver Method**

**→ How to take advantage of your internal pattern recognition system**

- notice novelty that leads to opportunity

If you take the time to write out in hand what you will accomplish, with as much clarity as possible. Don’t worry about the how. Then, re-deploy your Release method.

→ **Answer may present itself in 3-5 minutes**

**→ Sleep on the Problem**

When you’re working, hold your focus on whatever it is you’re doing. Keep it consistent. And resist the urge to self-distract. When you do, you reset your flow cycle. Persist through the Struggle Phase, knowing the Flow stage is just around the corner.

Exercise: Release Triggers

1. Release walk for exercise induced transient hypofrontality
    
2. 10 minute parasympathetic box breathing:
    

- inhale 4 seconds
- hold 4 seconds
- exhale 4 seconds
- hold 4 seconds

3. Slow Gentle Stretching

- Walk around, touch your toes, move around

### Flow vs. Anti-Flow Cycles: How to Stay Engaged and Growing

### Introduction:

At the heart of any thriving organization or team is a simple idea: stay clear, stay engaged, and keep growing. When the right conditions are met, we tap into flow—where things just click, and progress feels natural. The opposite is anti-flow, where confusion, control, and withdrawal take over, leading to decline. This guide breaks down these two cycles, showing how to move from stagnation to thriving.

![Story Cycle.jpg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b8e85976-7a1f-4571-90a0-cb346458cb39/5bcea9af-594e-4fd3-a526-de5e031fa793/Story_Cycle.jpg)

### **Flow Cycle:**

1. **Clarity**
    - What’s the aim? Everyone needs to know what the team or company is working towards. With a clear vision, people know what to focus on and why it matters.
2. **Autonomy**
    - Freedom to act. Once the goal is clear, give people the freedom to figure out how to get there. When people feel trusted to make decisions, they bring their best ideas to the table.
3. **Engagement**
    - All-in. When people understand the mission and have the freedom to pursue it, they get fully engaged. Work becomes meaningful, and everyone is driven to do their best.
4. **Renewal**
    - Recharge. After periods of deep focus, it’s important to step back and recharge. This keeps energy levels high and prevents burnout, ensuring long-term success.

### **Anti-Flow Cycle:**

1. **Ambiguity**
    - No clear direction. Without a clear goal, people get lost. Priorities clash, and no one knows what really matters.
2. **Control**
    - Micromanagement. When leadership steps in with too much control, it kills creativity. People stop thinking for themselves and only follow orders.
3. **Withdrawal**
    - Checking out. Faced with control and confusion, people disengage. They stop caring, lose motivation, and simply go through the motions.
4. **Decline**
    - Going downhill. Over time, this leads to decline—less innovation, lower performance, and higher turnover.

### **How to Use the Flow Cycle:**

1. **Define the Goal:**
    - Be clear on what you’re aiming for. Everyone should know the goal and why it matters.
2. **Trust Your Team:**
    - Give people the freedom to make decisions and take ownership of their work.
3. **Keep People Engaged:**
    - Make sure work feels meaningful. Show how each role contributes to the bigger picture.
4. **Build in Rest:**
    - Encourage regular breaks and reflection to prevent burnout and keep energy high.

### Conclusion:

Moving from anti-flow (Ambiguity, Control, Withdrawal, Decline) to flow (Clarity, Autonomy, Engagement, Renewal) is all about creating the right conditions. Keep things clear, trust your team, and make space for renewal. With these steps, teams can stay engaged, energized, and ready to grow.

### **Crafting a Generative Story: A Narrative Framework for Direction & Flow**

#### **1. The Call to Adventure: "Take the Chances"**

**Narrative Hook:**  
_"Every morning, you stand at a crossroads—not just of tasks, but of identity. Will you repeat yesterday, or step into the version of yourself who dares, creates, and evolves? Life is motion. Stagnation is an illusion. The question isn’t whether you’ll change, but how."_

**Key Beats for Your Story:**

- **The Invitation:** Frame each day as a chance to pivot. Example:
    
    - _"What if today you said ‘no’ to what drains you and ‘yes’ to one bold action that aligns with your future self?"_
        
- **The Stakes:**
    
    - _"The cost of standing still isn’t safety—it’s regret. The path of least resistance is the slowest path to irrelevance."_
        
- **The Antidote:**
    
    - _"Small steps compound. A 1% change today rewrites your story in a year."_
        

**Why It Works for Flow:**

- A narrative of agency primes your brain to act. Flow follows intentionality.

#### **2. The Crisis: "You Aren’t as Valuable as You Think"**

**Narrative Hook:**  
_"The world isn’t conspiring against you—it’s indifferent. The real threat isn’t AI or automation; it’s your own passivity. You were trained to follow, not to hunt. But survival now demands reinvention."_

**Key Beats for Your Story:**

- **The Wake-Up Call:**
    
    - _"You’ve been sold a lie: that compliance equals security. But the future belongs to those who see problems others ignore and solve them with relentless creativity."_
        
- **The Villain:**
    
    - _"Not technology, but complacency. Not algorithms, but borrowed visions."_
        
- **The Turning Point:**
    
    - _"The moment you stop waiting for permission is the moment you become irreplaceable."_
        

**Why It Works for Flow:**

- A crisis narrative creates urgency. Flow thrives on challenge.

#### **3. The Revelation: "It Was a Musical Thing"**

**Narrative Hook:**  
_"You’ve been told life is a pilgrimage—a grind toward some distant ‘success.’ But what if the prize isn’t at the end? What if the point is to dance while the music plays?"_

**Key Beats for Your Story:**

- **The Paradigm Shift:**
    
    - _"Retirement isn’t the goal. Mastery is. Creation is. The joy is in the work itself."_
        
- **The Hero’s Insight:**
    
    - _"At 40, you won’t feel ‘arrived.’ You’ll feel like you—just with better stories."_
        
- **The New Metric:**
    
    - _"Judge your days by depth, not productivity. By aliveness, not accumulation."_
        

**Why It Works for Flow:**

- A story that celebrates process over outcomes aligns with flow’s intrinsic rewards.

### **How to Weave These Into Your Generative Narrative**

#### **1. Structure Your Story in Three Acts**

1. **The Awakening** (Call to Adventure + Crisis):
    
    - _"I once believed [old story]. Then I realized [awakening]. Now I see [new truth]."_
        
2. **The Hunt** (Crisis + Action):
    
    - _"Every day, I choose to [specific practice]. I solve [problem] by [unique approach]. The hunt is the joy."_
        
3. **The Dance** (Revelation):
    
    - _"I’m not waiting for ‘success.’ I’m here to [create/explore/build]—and the work itself is the reward."_
        

#### **2. Make It Personal**

- **Replace abstract advice with "I" statements:**
    
    - _"I used to fear irrelevance. Now I lean into my weirdness—it’s my competitive edge."_
        
- **Use vivid contrasts:**
    
    - _"Before: I saved my best ideas for ‘someday.’ Now: I prototype them by Tuesday."_
        

#### **3. Embed Flow Triggers**

- **Clarity:** _"My mission is [X]. Every morning, I ask: Does this task serve it?"_
    
- **Challenge:** _"I seek problems that scare me 20%—enough to grow, not paralyze."_
    
- **Autonomy:** *"I design my days to protect [2-3 flow hours] for my highest-leverage work."*

### **Final Thought: Your Story Is Your Operating System**

A generative narrative isn’t inspiration—it’s infrastructure. It:

- **Filters distractions** (Does this fit my story?).
    
- **Fuels persistence** (Setbacks are plot twists, not endings.).
    
- **Turns flow into a byproduct** (When you’re immersed in a story worth living, focus follows.).
    

**Start drafting yours today:**

1. Name your old story.
    
2. Define your crisis moment.
    
3. Write your new mantra: _"I am someone who [action] because [belief]."_
    

Example:  
_"I am someone who ships imperfect ideas daily because done is better than perfect—and perfect is the enemy of flow."_

### **The Meta-Physics of Time: How Temporal Perception Shapes Compelling Stories and Flow States**

#### **1. The Dual Nature of Time**

Time exists in two parallel dimensions:

- **Clock Time**: The objective, measurable flow of seconds, hours, and deadlines.
    
- **Subjective Time**: Your brain’s elastic perception—where an hour of flow feels like minutes, and a minute of boredom feels like eternity.
    

**Key Insight**:

- _Masterful narratives and flow states manipulate subjective time._ A gripping story compresses clock time (you forget the hours spent reading). Flow dilates it (you lose yourself in the work).
    

---

#### **2. Presentism vs. Eternalism: The Storyteller’s Dilemma**

- **Presentism**: Only the "now" is real. _Use this for urgency_:
    
    - _"This moment is all you have. Act."_
        
    - _Flow trigger_: Deep focus on the present task.
        
- **Eternalism**: Past, present, and future coexist. _Use this for meaning_:
    
    - _"Your actions today ripple across time."_
        
    - _Flow trigger_: Connecting work to a larger timeline (legacy, purpose).
        

**Narrative Hack**:

- Alternate between them. A hero’s journey needs **presentism** (the sword fight _now_) and **eternalism** (the prophecy that spans ages).

#### **3. Time-Bending for Flow and Story**

**How to Stretch/Compress Time Perception**:

|**Method**|**For Flow**|**For Narrative**|
|---|---|---|
|**Novelty**|New challenges keep focus sharp.|Plot twists defy predictability.|
|**Experience Density**|Rich, multi-sensory work environments.|Vivid scenes make story time feel "full."|
|**Pattern Interrupts**|Breaks reset attention.|Flashbacks/pacing changes jar the reader.|
|**Mindfulness**|Anchors you in the task.|Immersive POV makes readers "live" the story.|

**Example**:

- _Flow_: A programmer loses track of clock time when debugging (high density + challenge).
    
- _Story_: A thriller’s "real-time" chapter makes readers forget they’ve been reading for hours.

#### **4. Crafting Stories That Hack Time**

1. **Leverage Parkinson’s Law**:
    
    - _"A task expands to fill the time allotted."_
        
    - _Narrative_: Impose deadlines on characters (e.g., "Bomb defusal in 3 minutes").
        
    - _Flow_: Set tight constraints (e.g., "Write 500 words in 25 minutes").
        
2. **First-Principles Time**:
    
    - Question: _"Why must this take X long?"_
        
    - _Narrative_: Compress a lifetime into a montage; stretch a moment into a chapter.
        
    - _Flow_: Reject "This will take weeks" thinking. Prototype in days.
        
3. **The "Timekeeper vs. Timebender" Conflict**:
    
    - _Timekeeper_: "I don’t have time!" (Victim to clock time).
        
    - _Timebender_: "I create time" (Chooses activities that warp perception).
        
    - _Narrative_: The hero who bends time (e.g., Neo in _The Matrix_).
        
    - _Flow_: Design days that feel expansive (e.g., mixing deep work, novelty, and rest).

#### **5. The Ultimate Narrative-Flow Loop**

- **Flow States** alter subjective time, making work effortless.
    
- **Stories** alter subjective time, making messages unforgettable.
    
- **Synergy**: A well-designed life narrative (your "mission") becomes a flow trigger. When you see your work as part of an epic, focus follows.
    

**Exercise**:

1. Write your life story in **eternalist** terms (all moments equally real).
    
2. Then script your week in **presentist** terms (only "now" exists).
    
3. Notice where the two versions collide—those are your flow leaks.
    

**Example**:

- _Eternalist_: "I’m writing a book that will outlive me."
    
- _Presentist_: "Today, I write 300 words with joy."
    
- _Flow Result_: The daily act feels connected to the timeless goal.

### **Conclusion: Time as Your Story’s Invisible Architecture**

- **Clock time** is the page count.
    
- **Subjective time** is the reader’s (or your) felt experience.
    
- **Mastery** lies in bending both to serve your mission.
    

**Final Prompt**:  
_"If your next year could feel like a decade of growth or a blink of stagnation, which activities would you add/remove?"_

This is the essence of intentional time—and the heart of all great stories.


**How to Bend Time**

**1) Activity Selection**

- Activities that extend our perception of time.
- High-level of variance

**2) Experience Density**

- Experiences that produce a wide range of emotion and sensory experience
- Can be elongating or shortening time.

**3) Novelty**

- Engaging in activities with varied, new stimulus.

**4) Experience Variety**

- Switching activities within a day to expand time.

**5) Embracing Boredom**

- Slowing down time by sitting without stimulation.

**6) Pattern Interrupts**

- Breaks monotony that causes time to pass rapidly.

**7) Flow Hacking**

- Accelerates or slows down time depending on the activity.

**8) Mindfulness**

- Bringing attention to the present moment.
