If you want to get stuck in the sorrows of life, think in matter. If you want to free the creative force of life, think in energy.

That’s the $100,000,000+ secret that I wish somebody told me at the start of the video game of life.

But they didn’t.

They told me the opposite.

So I adopted the thinking of the time and started thinking in matter just like everybody else.

In other words:

What I saw is what I thought was actually there.

But it really wasn’t (reality is much spookier than that). What I saw was just free-flowing concentrated energy (inputs) in the form of matter (outputs), but by only seeing the physical matter…

Not only was I unable to influence or manipulate the underlying energy to create real change, but the physical matter was sticky to the touch and kept my current situation glued in place.

To make matters worse (pun intended):

By operating solely on the physical plane, I struggled to create real transformation in my life because not only was I working on the symptoms instead of the root cause, but the physical plane is also the hardest plane to create change on.

And this isn’t something you have to take my word for either. We can prove it with a simple thought experiment:

How long would it take you to fill a bathtub with $10,000,000?

Quite long, right?

For sure.

Now imagine yourself in your mind's eye filling a bathtub with $10,000,000.

How long did that take?

Pretty fast, right?

For sure.

This is the case because it’s easier to turn nothing into something aka change the invisible (i.e. energy) than it is to turn something into something aka change the visible (i.e. matter).

But that’s not the point of this email (besides you knew that already).

Point of this email is that the entire world tricked you.

They tricked you into believing your eyes and taking what you see (matter) to be the only thing that actually exists.

As a result:

You only really experience one half aka the ‘face’ of life.

In other words:

You only see the outputs/visible (matter), but you don’t see the inputs aka invisible hand of God at play (energy).

This, in return, keeps you stuck and limited because the only tools you have access to are tools that fall into the physical domain.

So you tie your forehead in knots, wrinkle your brow, and work your life away to fill up the bathtub with $10,000,000.

Maybe you’ll do it one day.

Maybe you won’t.

It doesn’t really matter.

What matters is even if you do, you’ll still be trapped because you’re not seeing the FULL picture.

Only half the picture.

And this, my friend, is no way to live.

So that’s what brings us to this email:

With this email, I’m going to (hopefully) open your eyes to a new way of living and working.

But I don’t want you to put your blind trust in this new way.

I want you to split test it with your current way of life and see what generates more results.

If it works better for you, then continue using it.

If it doesn’t, scrap it altogether.

Cool?

There’s nothing to believe here.

Only an invitation to experiment.

So if you’re down with that, then here is my 6-step process for manipulating energy for fun and profit.

The Process

Below I reveal the process. Then I’ll walk you through each step of the process in detail. And finally I’ll wrap up with some concluding thots.

Cool?

Let’s go! :-)

Here’s the process:

Step 1 – Become energy Step 2 – Protect energy Step 3 – Build energy Step 4 – Amplify energy Step 5 – Direct energy Step 6 – Renew energy

(Repeat steps 2-6 every single day for the rest of your life)

I admit, this doesn’t sound like much (besides new age pie in the sky airy fairy bullshit).

But the glory is in the details.

So let’s now undress the details step-by-step.

Step 1. Become Energy

In the conventional view, you are taught that you are a person. This, in return, creates a fence around your body and separates you from the rest of the Universe.

Consequence of this?

You become limited to the world of matter because who you are is what you see and what you see is what gives rise to what you experience.

Meaning:

You become a physical person living in a physical universe (that is perceived to be outside and separate from you).

With the unconventional view, on the other hand, you realize that yes you are this person on the physical plane, but once you break this person down to his/her building blocks… you realize that the person is made up of energy.

Moreover:

The energy that makes up the person is no different than the energy that makes up the entire Universe.

So put another way:

There is no separation in Objective Reality.

Only ONE free-flowing Energy.

(I’m using the word ‘energy’ here even though I dislike that word since it’s become too woo-woo, but you can easily swap it out for consciousness or presence or reality or space or whatever.)

This is the first and most important thing to realize because it frees you from just operating on the physical plane and opens you up to the underlying world of energy.

Question now becomes:

How do you become energy?

Here’s how:

Sit down, close your eyes, and sense your body.

Feel it from the inside out.

Now expand your sensing and sense the space that is in the room. Now expand your sensing even more and sense the space that is in the entirety of your house. Now expand your sensing even more and sense the space that is in your neighborhood. Now expand your sensing even more and sense the space that is in your city. Now expand your sensing even more and sense the space that is in your country. Now expand your sensing even more and sense the space that is in the entire world. Now expand your sensing even more and sense the space that is in the entire Universe.

You can do it to some degree, can’t you?

Of course.

If a person was all that you were, your sensing would start and stop with your physical body.

But it doesn’t.

Because what you actually are is a self-aware energy/space in which the totality of the world is housed in (including your body).

So you can actually sense the entire thing because you are it.

[This is why you can sense when somebody across the room is thinking or speaking about you because it’s all existing inside the field of energy/consciousness that you are.]

Ok, now onto the next step.

Step 2. Protect Energy

Now that you know energy is all there is and you are it, you’re probably wondering to yourself:

"What’s the practical significance of this?"

And the significance is:

Energy eventually turns into matter (through identification).

So what you expose energy to is what you end up becoming.

If you expose energy to doom and gloom, then you become doom and gloom.

On the contrary:

If you expose energy to abundance and winning, then you become abundant and a winner.

With that noted, it’s extremely important that you learn to protect the energy that you are because the world is competing for your energy. Not only that, but the world wants to turn your energy into matter that serves them instead of you.

It’s for this reason that the majority of the world ends up divorced, obese, diabetic, depressed, and broke.

If that’s not what you want (who does?), then it’s extremely important to accept responsibility for everything that enters your consciousness/space and protect your energy.

Question is: How do you protect your energy?

Here’s how:

Avoid complainers Avoid gossipers Avoid doomscroming Avoid porn Avoid drugs Avoid alcohol Avoid sugar Avoid toxic media Avoid politics Avoid news Avoid current events Avoid blue light Avoid processed foods

All these suck your energy dry and turn you into a shadow of a shadow of yourself.

So avoid or drastically cut down.

Now onto the next step.

Step 3. Build Energy

Okay at this point of the game you’ve unraveled the physical person and recognized yourself and the entire universe to be made up of energy. Moreover, you’ve learned to accept responsibility for this energy and stop prostituting it out without care.

Now what?

Now it’s time to actually strengthen your individual energy field by building energy instead of leaking energy.

Question thus becomes:

How do you build energy?

Here’s how:

Sleep 8-9 hours Get sunlight at sunrise for 10-30 minutes Eat a clean diet Drink high quality spring water Exercise/move for 30-60 minutes daily

These actions, in return, will kick start the process of building your personal energy field. The more you do these actions, the more powerful your energetic field will become.

But that’s not all.

In addition to these simple actions, you also want to amplify your energy by connecting it to high quality power sources.

So let’s get into that now.

Step 4. Amplify Energy

You amplify your energy by plugging into powerful sources of energy that allow you to break free from linear thinking (programming of the time) and open up to quantum thinking (nonlinear breakthroughs).

What are the most powerful energy sources?

God, nature, meditation, visualization.

By embracing these raw sources of energy, you plug your individual consciousness/energy into the most powerful energy sources known to man.

So, how exactly do you do it?

Here’s how (or at least… enough to get you going!):

God – If you want to increase your belief in God, study your religion. If you want to experience God, study the mystics of your religion. Don’t settle for belief when you can know. Nature – Sunrise, walks all day, sunset. No phone or podcasts or technology. Just you melting your boundaries in the presence of nature. Forests, woods, beaches, parks, grass fields. Touch grass. Daily and often. Meditation – Sit down (back straight), close your eyes, and follow your breath for 15-20 minutes with zero expectations. Do this daily and ideally first thing in the morning. Visualization – See the version of yourself that exists x time from now. The one that achieved everything you set out to do. See it clearly. Now take that version and 'infuse' it into your current body with your current circumstances. Now play the game from his/her eyes.

Ok. At this point, you have learned to become energy AND protect, build, and amplify.

Now onto the last two steps.

Step 5. Direct Energy

This is the most important step.

Reason why is: The entire point of thinking in energy is it allows you to accumulate MORE power and then direct THAT power towards pulling your ideal future into the here and now.

(Reread that a few times.)

This is exactly what we’ve done with the prior steps.

Now:

We can take all that built up energy and convert it into physical matter and generate the results you seek.

Question now becomes:

How exactly do you direct your energy?

Here’s how:

Come up with ONE intention that you want to actualize in your life and write it in the past or present tense 10-15x daily like a mad man on a mission (example: I am [Name] and I easily make $1,000,000+/month) Pin point 1-3 daily levers aka tasks that will allow you to actualize the intention that you set forth Invest 4-6 hours of deep work daily towards the actualization of your intention by pulling the 1-3 daily levers w/ FOCUS

Nothing less. Nothing more.

By doing the above, you laser all the power you’ve built towards your ONE main intention with maximum force. And you do it daily. So it has no choice, but to turn into physical matter.

In other words:

E=MC2

[Bigger the dream, the bigger the energy is needed.]

Such is the way to make the impossible possible.

But it’s not the only step.

One more step remains so let’s cover that now.

Step 6. Renew Energy

Once you take all the energy you built through steps 1-4 and you direct it towards your main intention via step 5 with 4-6 hours of deep work, then you’re going to be feeling similar to how you feel after you orgasm during sex.

Meaning:

You’re going to be drained of energy. And need to relax, rest, and rejuvenate so you can wake up the next day and have the required power levels to consistently execute against your 1-3 daily levers in 4-6 hours.

This, in return, brings us to the importance of renewing your energy on a daily basis (just like you take a physical shower to cleanse yourself… it’s important to renew your energy daily too).

So again, how do you renew your energy?

Here’s how:

Laughter Long walks Grounding in nature Taking a nap Ice plunge Sauna Massage Red light therapy Spending quality time with loved ones

Pick 1-2 things and do them daily.

You can always rotate through the list and pick whatever floats your boat on any given day.

But the important thing is that you actually renew your energy.

By doing so:

You officially complete the circular process and will start to actualize whatever intention you set (in due time).

In other words:

You will become an ‘energy manipulator’ and start manipulating energy for fun and profit (or whatever else you want).

With that all noted, let’s now wrap up this newsletter with some quick and dirty concluding thots.

Concluding Thots

I only have 2 concluding thots.

The first thot may scare you, but the second thot will liberate you.

Here’s the first:

Thot #1) The battle for your soul is really a battle for your energy. If they take your energy, they take your soul.

And here’s the second:

Thot #2) When you think in matter, you break your life into areas:

Financial Relationships Health Spirituality Hobbies Adventures

This, in return, contracts your power because you’re shooting in all different directions.

Plus:

It stresses you out because it’s difficult to manage the entirety of your life. One area upgrading often means another is downgrading.

But when you think in energy, something different happens.

Life goes from being separated into different buckets to becoming one flow and the way you approach your finances to your relationships to your health to your spirituality to your hobbies to your adventures becomes more similar than different.

In other words:

You don’t apply x ‘strategy’ to grow your finances and y strategy to grow your relationship.

Nope.

You apply the same strategy which is the 6-step process (but simply add new intentions during step 5 to cover those areas of your life).

The better you get at applying this, the more everything upgrades in your life as a result (because it’s all just the same play of free-flowing energy and power).

With that noted:

The highest skill to master inside the video game of life is energy manipulation and you now know how to do it.

Or at least…

Enough to get you started.

So get started and allow the matter to speak for itself?

Thanks for reading.

Your friend,

P.S. 90% of people struggle to get what they want out of the video game of life because they do the opposite of the 6-step process.

Instead of becoming free flowing energy (with no boundaries), they become a person (giving rise to separation/contraction/fear/isolation/anxiety/worry/stress).

Instead of building energy, they lose energy by having shit sleep, poor diet, lousy exercise habits.

Instead of amplifying energy, they deplete energy through porn, drugs, and alcohol.

Instead of directing energy, they work without focus and are easily distracted by social media and technology.

Instead of renewing energy, they further wreak havoc on their energy by watching blue light aka television.

All this, in return, turns them into a shadow of a shadow of their energetic potential and leads to a lousy existence.

If that’s what you want, then that’s what you’ll get.

But if you want to move past the current way of living and evolve to a newer and funner way, then I invite you to apply the 6-steps consciously and with the mind of a scientist.

In other words:

Run the split test & see what happens to matter :-)
